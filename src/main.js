// ITERATION 3 - Saving & Viewing Posters - GOAL: complete Saturday evening; refactor Sunday and work on the README; review DTR
// ‚àö When a user clicks the ‚ÄúSave This Poster‚Äù button, the current main poster will be added to the savedPosters array.
// ‚àö If a user clicks the ‚ÄúSave This Poster‚Äù more than once on a single poster, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates)
// ‚àö When a user clicks the ‚ÄúShow Saved Posters‚Äù button, we should see the saved posters section
// All the posters in the `savedPosters` array should be displayed in the saved posters grid section
// all elements stored within the `savedPosters` array will be displayed on the page {nd}
// build a function that will display all the saved posters; might this use innerHTML? {nd}
// there is a class `saved-posters-grid` on line 38 of the HTML that will likely come into play here {nd}
// 1) target the saved-posters-grid and store in a variable (query selector)
// 2) values stored in the savedPosters array should be displayed in the grid
// 3) use innerHTML to add the values to the array
// 4) use a for loop (?) to iterate through savedPosters and build each mini poster
// 5) each iteration will += the innerHTML to add it to the display section
// 6) each iteration will reassign the values contained within the HTML structure to savedPosters[i].image, savedPosters[i].title, savedPosters[i].quote
// 7) use the structure in the HTML on lines 12 - 16 as a guide:
// <article class="poster">
  // <img class="poster-img" src="" alt="nothin' to see here">
  // <h1 class="poster-title">Title</h1>
  // <h3 class="poster-quote">Quote</h3>
// </article>


// ITERATION 4 - Deleting Saved Posters - STRETCH GOAL: if we complete iteration 3 goals early (on Saturday) we will divide and each attempt iteration 4 (with communication)
// From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
