# Hang in there!
#### a fun app to generate random motivational posters, and make your own!

![image or gif](link in the parens) - I will work on this in the morning!

[Make your own poster!](https://pcmueller.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)

#### Overview & [Project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/hang-in-there.html) Goals
- Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? Weâ€™re going to make our own!
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#### Learning Goals
- Develop a better understanding of learned concepts
- Work on teaching strategies to grow as a developer
- Get more reps and add to toolbox and tying concepts together
- Work on teamwork and remote collaboration skills

#### Why was this project created?
- This project was created to teach the fundamentals of working on a team and implementing vanilla JavaScript to create a basic web application

#### How does this work?
![homepage screenshot](link in the parens)
- Each page load will automatically generate a random motivational poster. From here, the user has options!
- The user may continue to generate random posters by clicking the `Show Another Random Poster Button`.
- To create their own poster, a user will click on `Make Your Own Poster`. This will pull up a form that accepts inputs for an image URL, a title, and a quote. Clicking `Show my poster` will return the user to the home page and display their new poster! There is also an option to return to the home page without creating a poster, by clicking `Nevermind, take me back!`
- Posters can also be stored for later viewing by clicking `Save This Poster`. This switches to a grid view displaying mini versions of all saved posters.

- To delete a poster, the user can double click the image.
- This applications runs directly in the web browser!

#### Project Reflection
##### Nichele
- I had a great experience during this project. Peter and I spent a good deal of time planning and discussing the problems, challenges we might face, and how to address problems when encountered.
##### Peter

##### Wins
##### Nichele
- I felt like our communication styles worked well together, and we were able to address coding challenges through discussion and solo pseudocoding.
- Planning! We spent a lot of time in discussion deciding how to address a problem before writing any code. This seemed to give us a clear direction without leaving us muddled in issues we hadn't accounted for.
- Our git workflow seemed to come together pretty quickly and I didn't have any issues with merges or pulls.
- We were able to reach out to mentors when we needed assistance, and were able to come up with a solution to our problem with some gentle nudging.
##### Peter

##### Challenges
##### Nichele
- I wish I had taken more notes! On the next project, I think I'll create a separate file within the project to store reflections and questions that come up during the project.
- We didn't really utilize our mentors for code reviews. Though we did discuss issues we were having, we didn't actually add them to any of the PR code reviews. Next time I would like to discuss a code review schedule with my mentors prior to beginning the project.

##### Overall Impressions
##### Nichele
- Overall this project went well for me! I was able to gain more experience working with another developer, and continue to look at what my interactions are like in those situations.
- I feel good about my progress in understanding the JavaScript logic and why certain solutions might be better than others.
- I was able to understand the DOM and how it interacted with our code, and how to add and remove elements from the page after the initial DOM tree was created.
- I learned a lot about what a good design and planning phase could mean for the future of a project and my own sanity during development! 
##### Peter

#### Future Features
- Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
- In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array
- When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
