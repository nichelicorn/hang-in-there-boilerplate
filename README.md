[Make your own poster!](https://pcmueller.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)

#### Overview & [Project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/hang-in-there.html) Goals
- Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? Weâ€™re going to make our own!
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#### Learning Goals
- Learning goals to develop a better understanding of learned concepts
- Work on teaching strategies to grow as a developer
- Get more reps and add to toolbox and tying concepts together
- Work on teamwork and remote collaboration skills

#### Why was this project created?
- This project was created to teach the fundamentals of working on a team and implementing vanilla JavaScript to create a basic web application

#### How does this work? (insert screen shots - will do tomorrow morning)
- Each page load will automatically generate a random motivational poster. From here, the user has options!
- The user may continue to generate random posters by clicking the `Show Another Random Poster Button`.
- To create their own poster, a user will click on `Make Your Own Poster`. This will pull up a form that accepts inputs for an image URL, a title, and a quote. Clicking `Show my poster` will return the user to the home page and display their new poster! There is also an option to return to the home page without creating a poster, by clicking `Nevermind, take me back!`
- Posters can also be stored for later viewing by clicking `Save This Poster`. This switches to a grid view displaying mini versions of all saved posters.
- To delete a poster, the user can double click the image.
- This applications runs directly in the web browser!

- When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
